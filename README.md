Tokenization: The text is divided into words and sentences for detailed analysis.
Stopword Removal: Commonly used words (e.g., "the," "and") that do not contribute to the core meaning are excluded.

Sentence Scoring: Sentences are evaluated by aggregating scores of the words they contain.
Summary Generation: The top sentences, covering 30% of the original content, are selected to form the summary.
